/*
 * Blargg-style NTSC/composite video filter, a scalar C99 port of the scalar
 * path of Shay Green's snes_ntsc 0.2.2.
 *
 * Ported from Deadly Dave’s scalar C99 port, retaining the LGPL 2.1+ license.
 *
 * The filter takes 15-bit RGB555 pixels (one palette index per pixel) and
 * writes 32-bit XRGB8888 pixels. Each input pixel is expanded into output
 * pixels at the composite-video horizontal sampling rate: 3 input columns
 * become 7 output columns, so a filtered image is wider than its source and is
 * meant to be stretched back to the same on-screen size.
 *
 * Initialisation precomputes a kernel for every one of the 32768 colours in
 * the RGB555 palette, which costs ~16 MB and a noticeable (one-off) amount of
 * time, so the caller creates the filter lazily and keeps it.
 *
